New
- Added Airplane mode and Bluetooth tiles, so you can restrict usage of these tiles on the lock screen
- Added a tile preview in the app itself
- Added individual tile configuration (currently only contains override for the general ‘require unlock’ setting)

Improvements
- A clean new user interface built on Material You
- User must now explicitly choose between root and Shizuku (before, it just tried both)
- Better permission requesting/handling:
  - No more automatic permission granting using shell commands (this was used to grant the 'READ_PHONE_STATE' permission without user knowledge)
  - When permissions are missing, this is now clearly visualized on the homepage, where you can then easily request them
- Switched all tiles to [active mode](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/quicksettings-tiles#active_mode_recommended). Instead of the tiles only updating when the quick settings were open, they will now be updated instantly through a background service that is always running. During the last weeks of testing this, I have noticed 0 battery usage using this new method. This should fix #1 and #20
- Bumped minimum Android  SDK to 31 (Android 12)
- Dependency updates
- Translations updates
