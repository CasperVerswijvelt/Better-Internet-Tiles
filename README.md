# Better Internet Tiles

This application aims to create a unified internet quick-settings tile, which is actually useful (I'm looking at you, Android 12). Next to this, separate Wi-Fi and mobile data tiles are also available if you just want to go back to the behaviour of Android 11 or lower.

Tapping the new unified internet tile will simply toggle between Wi-Fi and mobile data, which is exactly what I want it to do most of the time. This reduces the amount of taps needed from 3 (tap tile, disable wifi, enable data) to just 1 quick tap. In situations where you still want more control, long pressing the tile will redirect you to the WiFi settings.

Shell access is required to enable/disable Wi-Fi and mobile data, as well as for reading the SSID of the current Wi-Fi network. This can be granted using [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) (root not required).

I have currently only tested this on my Pixel 6, where it works well.
