# Better Internet Tiles

A better unified internet quicksettings tile for Android

## About

This application aims to create a unified internet quick-settings tile, which is actually useful (I'm looking at you, Android 12).
Tapping the tile will simply toggle between Wi-Fi and mobile data, while long pressing will direct you to the internet settings screen.
Unfortunately, root access is required to enable/disable Wi-Fi and mobile data, as well as for reading the SSID of the current Wi-Fi network.
